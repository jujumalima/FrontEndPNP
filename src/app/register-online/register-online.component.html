            No alcohol for sale to persons under 18 years
            Alcohol can only be purchased by customers who are 18 years or older.
            Pricing policy
            You will be charged the prices as they are reflected on the Products in store at the point of sale, subject to availability. Certain of the Products are variable/random mass items. Whilst the average mass of the Product is indicated on the Online Shopping Site as a guide to the cost, the actual Product delivered to you may weigh slightly more or less than the average mass indicated. You will be charged the actual amount due in respect of the specific Product delivered to you. Prices include Value-Added Tax. Special promotions may be subject to certain conditions, including stock availability and limited offer stipulations. A delivery fee will be charged for each order placed by you. Please visit our Website to view the delivery fee applicable.
            Methods of payment
            We will debit the total value of your online order against the payment card tendered by you during the check out process. Payment will be effected on acceptance of your order and prior to delivery. By submitting your order, identity number and payment card details you warrant that you are over the age of 18 (eighteen), are authorised to make payment with the payment card and that there are sufficient funds available to pay for the order.
            Stock availability
            Pick n Pay cannot always guarantee availability of stock and will endeavour to deliver a substitute line where possible. If we are unable to supply each and every item ordered or in the quantities ordered, you nevertheless agree to accept delivery and make payment for the items correctly delivered.
            Confirmation of orders
            Orders placed online constitute your offer to purchase subject to these Terms. Your offer is deemed to have been accepted by us when you receive our confirmation of your order. Failure by us to formally confirm or notify acceptance shall not affect the validity of the sale or the enforceability thereof.
            Delivery
            Pick n Pay delivery timeslots are as follows: Monday - Friday: 09:00-15:00; 15:00-17:00 and 17:00-19:00. Saturday: 09:00-15:00; 15:00-17:00. There are NO deliveries on Sundays and Public Holidays. Deliveries are effected on the day following the placement of your order on our site unless you have chosen to accept delivery at a later date. The sale and delivery of liquor is subject to national and regional statutory regulations. Accordingly we may not accept orders for delivery of liquor where this is prohibited. Delivery slots where delivery of liquor is prohibited are indicated as such on the checkout page. Alcohol purchases will require proof of age on delivery. Failure to supply such proof will render the sale null and void. We only deliver to registered customers within certain specified delivery areas. On delivery of the order to the specified delivery address, you will receive our delivery note showing the items delivered, any substitute items, any non-available items, the delivery fees, Value-Added Tax and the amount debited from your payment card. For verification purposes, the person accepting delivery at the delivery address may be required to produce a form of identification. Any person other than yourself who receives the products at the delivery address is presumed to be authorised to accept delivery on your behalf. Should no-one be in attendance at the time of delivery, the driver will keep the products and leave a notice at the delivery address to this effect. The driver will attempt to contact you to make new arrangements for delivery or collection. We reserve the right to charge an additional delivery fee should it be required in the circumstances. Our liability for failing to deliver the products timeously is limited to delivery being effected at a later agreed time at no additional charge. Please arrange that you or your authorised representative is available to accept your purchases at the delivery address and that appropriate access will be made available. On delivery, we will require you or your authorised representative to sign and print your or their name on a duplicate copy of the delivery note, to confirm receipt. We have outsourced all delivery and collection arrangements. Accordingly, we cannot, to the extent permitted by law, be liable for any damage suffered or loss incurred by reason of any acts or omissions of the deliverer, its directors, employees, sub-contractors, agents, representatives and/or affiliates.
            Refunds and returns policy
